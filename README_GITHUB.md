### Move to the deployment directory

```bash
cd [git checkout directory]/deployment
```

### Update bootstrap data (optional)

Only if a change is needed in the initial content. It is possible to dump the
data that was manually created and make it a fixture. This involves opening a
shell in the running container (`docker exec -ti deployment_django_1 bash`), cd'ing
to the `/ateliersoude` directory and running `./manage.py`. Look at the
`quotation/fixtures/quotation/README.txt` file for more.

### Running the application

After cd'ing to the main directory (and having docker-compose installed), do this only once
```bash
./start.sh create_env
```

(later: fill in the environment variables like passwords in here)
Then to run the application:

```bash
./start.sh dev
```

### Logs

Having the logs displayed to STDOUT is done with `docker logs -f ateliersoude-django`
except for the dev server where they're displayed by default (container isn't detached)

### Get into the containers

- Application:  `docker exec -ti deployment_django_1 bash`
- Database: ` docker exec -ti deployement_ateliersoude-postgres_1 bash`

### Fixture data

You can find some already implemented [users fixtures](users/fixtures/users/001_users.json) such as :

login: `admin@example.com`
passwd: `foobar`

### Unit Tests

To run unit tests:

`docker-compose -f deployment/docker-compose.yml run --rm django python ateliersoude/manage.py test plateformeweb.tests --settings=ateliersoude.settings.test`

### Debugger

Need a debugger ? in your view file :

```
from ipdb import set_trace

set_trace()
```

to make it interactive run thet test with external ports, add `--service-ports` to the test command.
